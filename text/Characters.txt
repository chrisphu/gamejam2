	Guiding traits - devout believer, all around good boi

Cultists - Fallen blood cells
	Story - A group of blood cells present during the papercut in another capillary. These blood cells survived but were emotionally scarred by the senseless violence.
		They have begun rebelling against the Heart by opposing the natural flow of blood and causing blockages in the veins. 
		They are also evangelising their story to anyone who'll hear it
	Guiding traits - bitter, vengeful, brotherly amongst each other, distrustful of those who "go with the flow"
		> Anxious about the future? 

Veins Store keeper (?)
	Story - An older blood cell. Was one of the first to settle down after the cultists started blocking the vein.
		Not really into all the mumbo jumbo of the cultists, just glad to stop flowing for a bit

	Nobody can be spurred into action
		Nobody saw the violence of the papercut incident to spur them into action
	On the whole, various levels of devout to the heart

White blood cells - Massive, silent holy knights. Generally open to aiding out the red blood cells, but not necessarily the best at preventing collateral damage

Bacteria - Animalistic, large beasts

Viruses - Tiny, mite-sized. Infests plasma (the liquid in the veins)

Platelets - Hard construction workers, very devout
