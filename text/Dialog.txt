Opening Cutscene: 

Scene 1 - Streamer: 
	Heck yeah shiny charizard!
	*tsssk* Ow!
	Dang, a papercut. 
	Hope it doesn't get infected or anything!
	Anyways, thanks for tuning into my unboxing remember to beat that subscribe button like your heart depends on it!

Scene 2 - Blood pouring out of torn blood vessel 
	Unnamed blood cell - Ahhhhhh! Save your self!
		It's too late for me but trust in the flow of the heart! 
		The heart will guide you to its embraaaaaaace
	* Unnamed blood cell falls out of body, slowly zooms out of view (as if falling from a great distance) *
	Main character - Noooooooooooo 
	* Hand out, holding edge of broken blood vessel
Scene 3 - Main character tumbling down the torn blood vessel
	*Falls into empty capillary*
	
	^ i'm envisioning a T-junction - the torn blood vessel goes "vertically" and the capillary the main char. falls into is "horizontal"


Capillary:

	Main char: 
		It looks like I managed to make it into a capillary. 
		I don't have any idea where to go. I just need to trust I can make it back to the warm embrace of the Heart
		Looks like a tight squeeze though...
		
		Screw it, trust the flow!
